    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz Lumaca Rigata Pasta</li>
            <li>½ lb Broccoli</li>
            <li>2 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>¼ cup Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup Cream</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Butter</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Capers</li>
            <li>1 oz Sliced Roasted Red Peppers</li>
            <li>¼ tsp Crushed Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the broccoli. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the stem, then cut the broccoli into small florets. Place on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat; arrange in an even layer. Roast 14 to 16 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Finely chop the peppers.</li>
            <li>In a medium pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the capers, chopped garlic, and chopped peppers; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened. Add the tomato paste and as much of the red pepper flakes as you'd like, depending on how spicy you'd like the dish to be. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Turn off the heat. Add 1/4 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter) and the cream (shaking the bottle before opening). Stir to combine. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>To the pan of sauce, add the cooked pasta, butter, and half the reserved pasta cooking water. Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the pasta is coated (if necessary, gradually add the remaining cooking water to ensure the pasta is thoroughly coated). Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Serve the finished pasta with the roasted broccoli on the side. Garnish with the cheese. Enjoy!</li>
